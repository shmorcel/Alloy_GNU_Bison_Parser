### If you have more questions
Leave an issue complaint. I will be happy to look at it and respond.

### If you have a comment or want to tell me I could have done something better
Please do! I can learn from you!

### If you want to use anything or be inspired, go ahead!
You can start from this repository like I did from this [one](https://github.com/jonathan-beard/simple_wc_example), by forking it. The history is missing, but the whole functions as expected.

### Know Issues: Ambiguities, Ambiguities everywhere!
If you are a Bison guru or you know exactly why, please let me know!

### To Compile This:
Just go into the build directory, clear up everything, and try the parser on the Alloy Modules that I included inside of the build/inputs directory. That's better than having you go find some yourself. You give this a try on the fly.

### Disclaimer: 
It has a lot of ambiguities. Do not rely on this for your thesis or whatever you have. Unless you want to reuse parts of it (AST) for you project, and you have simple language to parse, then go ahead! See the patterns, the ideas and pick something up! This [article](http://sinanmorcel.com/project/an-alloy-parser/) goes perfectly with it.
